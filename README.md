### Docker (Production)

```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL in .env.production

## Tech Choices

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14 App Router | Server components + server actions eliminate a separate API layer |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma | Type-safe queries, schema migrations, relation support |
| Auth | NextAuth.js | Session-based, role-extensible, credential + OAuth-ready |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties | Utility-first; design tokens enable light/dark theming |
| Charts | Inline SVG polyline | Zero dependencies; sufficient for dashboard sparklines |
| PDF | Browser print dialog | No server-side library needed; works offline, native |
| CSV | Custom `buildCSV()` | UTF-8 BOM included; no dependency |
| Containers | Docker + docker-compose | Single-command deploy; health check via `127.0.0.1:3000` (IPv4 explicit for Alpine) |
